        answer: 'In-house EME production provides independence from suppliers, ability to quickly respond to customer needs, quality assurance of products, optimization of logistics costs, and lower cost of blasting operations.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is it possible to conduct drilling and blasting operations in challenging climatic conditions?',
        answer: 'Yes, the company specializes in conducting drilling and blasting operations in various climatic conditions, including Far North conditions with extremely low temperatures and challenging terrain.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What drilling technologies does the company use?',
        answer: 'The company uses modern drilling technologies with high-performance equipment, including down-the-hole hammer drilling rigs, rotary drilling rigs of various diameters, as well as rotary drilling technologies.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How is quality control carried out during blasting operations?',
        answer: 'Quality control is carried out at all stages of preparation and execution of blasting operations: from design to analysis of results. Modern electronic initiation systems are used to accurately control the blasting process, computer modeling methods are applied, and strict control of drilling and blasting parameters is maintained.'
